I seek **self-motivated Ph.D./Master/Undergraduate students** with solid **Cybersecurity** and **Computer Systems** backgrounds. Further, just like me, you must be passionate about **Artificial Intelligence** and **LLMs**. If you want to pursue a Ph.D. under my supervision, please email me your **CV, transcripts,** and/or **publications**. Visiting scholars and capable students (high school and above) are also welcome.



Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
